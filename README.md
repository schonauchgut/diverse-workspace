# Diverse Workspaces for Diverse Workforces
How are we going to work in the future?

## About
This is an overview of diverse workspace models for diverse workforces. As more and more corporations announce their post-covid19 workspace models more and more options emerge ranging from back-for-good over hybrid to super-progressive. This repository aims to provide you with an overview of potential models and a detailed list of employers that went public with their future working model (to be established). Hope it may be of use and inspiration for both employers and employees alike. The list is by no means exhaustive but will benefit from your pull-requests. 

## Models
*Those models are defined as they came to attention to the authors of this list and are influenced by media coverage. Therefore, you might have come across that model in another context or connected to another employer*

### adidas Model – "Teamsport"
While we are lacking final confirmation from Herzogenaurach, the place of adidas headquarter, Kasper Rorsted, CEO of the brand with the three stripes, has already set the tone for adidas future workspace. "Working is a social thing, it's teamsport for us". While this undeniable true or possible even for remote workers (as we learned in the past year), the Danish boss is not a fan of full time remote. A recent *Handelsblatt* article suggests 1-2 days remote [Handelsblatt]https://www.handelsblatt.com/karriere/karriere-die-hybrid-illusion-vier-unbequeme-wahrheiten-ueber-die-zukunft-der-arbeit/27249946.html.  While it needs to be seen how adidas ultimately decides, there is certainly room for a model marketing "teamsport" as a core value and as a driver for a rather physically-present than remote workforce.

### Apple Model – "Steerd Hybrid"
Apple or Tim Cook just recently announced in a excessively quoted mail to staff, that Apple is intending to have most staff on-site on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday with an option for remote work on Thursday and Friday. While this is an option of less freedom for employees it may have a positive steering effect for the employer (not saying that this outruns freedom of employees). Having three focus days makes it easier to estimate when your colleague is around, organise in person meetings and is important for facility management or catering.

### Government Model – "Limited by Technology"
Not an issue the most tech giants have. For governments the question of remote work still highly depends on the IT infrastructure available and the duties. Many authorities still require in person meetings of their workforce and citizens (at least in Germany) or files aren't digitalised. The IT infrastructure is often not up-to-date. Where private corporations have their workforce equipped with docking stations, laptops and smartphones – the reality of governmental organisations is often 180 degrees opposite. The "Limited by Technology"-scheme is therefore certainly sticking around for some more time.

### KPMG Model – "The thought through"
Secretly the reason to start this list. KPMG announced supporting policies for remote working. Despite those policies not being formal it is remarkable to see what a listening approach can achieve. KPMG discourages meetings on Wednesday afternoons, suggests camera free Fridays and shorter meetings as well as fewer meetings in the morning. All with the intention (among others probably) to promote wellbeing of the remote workforce. This is not exactly like the models listed here but a rolemodel how workforce should be taken into account when thinking about future workplaces.

### Lawfirm Model – "Sorry, we have done this before"
It's almost never fair to be thrown in one basket with others and there are certainly examples of forwardthinking and progressive lawfirms (also with regard to their workspace and workforce) but for the sake of illustration lawfirms are ideal. Especially after having heard and seen that quite a few firms struggled to accept that working from home should be priority during the pandemic over having their people present. Fast forward one and a half year partners and senior counsels are eagerly awaiting their associates back at their desks as nothing ever happened. Only an employee I physically see is a working employee. And after all, we have done this before. Please be present.  

### Porsche Model – "The X-Factor"
Something we are probably going to see frequently. Porsche offers x=12 days of home office per month – that's 2-3 days per week. While it remains to be seen how this is actually be filled with life, it is giving employees clear guidance and is a clear commitment to candidates for job offers. Interesting side note: Porsche did not only announce the 12 days rule but also that it comes with a tech package which is said to include a large display.

### SAP Model – "The trusting one"
All in. SAP asked their workforce and they decided or gave an estimate. SAP is giving their employees all freedom to decide on whether to be present or not. Certainly a smart choice knowing that SAP is heavily in the cloud business and should have an interest in a high rate of acceptance for remote work or remote infrastructure. Definitely a signal of trust and flexibility. Interesting to see how this will play out in the longrun, e.g. on the market for talents.
